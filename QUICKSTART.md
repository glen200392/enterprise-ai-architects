# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Enterprise AI Architects

**Get your first AI architecture consultation in 5 minutes!**

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- ✅ A [Nebula.gg](https://nebula.gg) account (free tier works)
- ✅ Access to the conversation interface
- ✅ 5 minutes of time

**No coding required for this quick start!**

## Step 1: Access Your AI Architect Team (30 seconds)

You already have access! This agent team is available in your Nebula workspace.

Simply ask:
```
"I need help designing an enterprise AI system"
```

---

## Step 2: Choose Your First Consultation (1 minute)

Pick one of these common scenarios:

### Option A: Design a RAG Pipeline
```
"I need to build a RAG system for our company knowledge base. 
We have 10,000 PDF documents. Can you help me design the architecture?"
```

### Option B: Evaluate AI Models
```
"We're choosing between GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini for our customer service bot.
Can you help us evaluate which model is best for our use case?"
```

### Option C: Optimize AI Costs
```
"Our AI API costs are $50,000/month. Can you analyze our usage 
and recommend cost optimization strategies?"
```

### Option D: Security Assessment
```
"We're building an AI system that will handle customer PII. 
Can you help us design a secure, compliant architecture?"
```

## Step 3: Delegate to the Right Agent (30 seconds)

Based on your scenario, the system will automatically route you to the best agent:

| Your Need | Agent That Will Help |
|-----------|---------------------|
| RAG pipeline design | **Advanced RAG Pipeline Architect** |
| Model evaluation | **AI Model Evaluation Advisor** |
| Cost optimization | **Cost Optimization Analyst** |
| Security & compliance | **Enterprise Security Architecture Specialist** |
| Overall strategy | **Enterprise AI Architect Director** |

## Step 4: Receive Your Analysis (2-3 minutes)

The agent will:
1. ✅ Ask clarifying questions about your requirements
2. ✅ Research best practices and current technologies
3. ✅ Deliver a comprehensive analysis with:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Technology recommendations
   - Cost estimates
   - Risk assessments
   - Implementation roadmap

## Example: Complete 5-Minute Session

### Your Request:
```
"I need to build a RAG system for 10,000 internal company PDFs. 
Budget is $5,000/month. We need < 2 second response time."
```

### Agent Response (Summary):
```
✅ Recommended Architecture:
- Document Processing: LlamaParse + semantic chunking
- Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small ($150/month)
- Vector Store: Pinecone Serverless ($500/month)
- Retrieval: Hybrid BM25 + dense retrieval
- Reranking: Cohere Rerank API ($200/month)
- LLM: GPT-4o-mini ($3,000/month estimated)

✅ Performance: 1.2s p95 latency (meets requirement)
✅ Total Cost: $3,850/month (20% under budget)
✅ Next Steps: [Detailed implementation plan]
```
