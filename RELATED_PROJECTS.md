### What It Is

FDE Super Team is a **24-agent network** designed for Forward Deployed Engineers who deliver complete client projects from ambiguous requirements to production deployment.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Enterprise AI Architects (This Repo) | FDE Super Team |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Focus** | Strategic architecture & design | Tactical project execution |
| **Team Size** | 20 agents | 24 agents |
| **Primary Users** | Enterprise architects, CTOs, technical leaders | Forward Deployed Engineers, project teams |
| **Core Scenarios** | AI platform design, LLMOps, governance | Client projects, migrations, on-site delivery |
| **Expertise Depth** | Deep (AI-specialized) | Broad (multi-domain) |
| **Capability Level** | L4.5-4.8 (Elite tier) | L3.5-4.5 |

### When to Use Each

#### Use **Enterprise AI Architects** (This Repo) When:
- Designing **enterprise-scale AI platforms** from scratch
- Need **strategic guidance** on AI adoption and governance
- Architecting **LLMOps pipelines** and production AI systems
- Require **security architecture** and compliance frameworks (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA)
- Optimizing **AI system performance** and cost at scale
- Building **RAG systems**, **agent orchestration**, or **HITL workflows**

#### Use **FDE Super Team** When:
- You need to **deliver a complete project** from requirements to deployment
- Working with **legacy system migrations** or **cloud migrations**
- Handling **ambiguous client requirements** that need clarification
- Require **on-site execution** and cross-functional coordination
- Need **broad technical coverage** across multiple domains

```

**Example Workflow**:
1. **Enterprise AI Architects** design the AI platform architecture
2. **FDE Super Team** executes the implementation across client sites
3. **FDE Team** provides field feedback on practical challenges
4. **AI Architects** refine patterns and best practices

**Combined Value**: Strategic vision meets practical execution, with continuous learning loops.
